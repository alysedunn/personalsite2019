                        <p>
                            I am a 'self taught' software engineer. That is to say: I don't have any formal education
                            in computer science. I received a bachelor's in Business Administration from the University
                            of Michigan in 2008, and then proceeded to teach myself how to code years after I graduated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a 'self-taught' engineer, I frequently get asked the question: 'How did you do it?
                            How did you just teach yourself how to code, with no formal education, and then get a job
                            doing it full-time?' I get this question so frequently that I posed it to five of my
                            NYC-based, self-taught colleagues, in an attempt to provide a more comprehensive resource
                            on how myself and others have successfully made this transition, and what advice they'd
                            give to others who want to do the same. Their responses ranged from moving to downright
                            hilarious. Read on for more information about how five different individuals made this
                            increasingly coveted career move.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><b>Q: What inspired you to learn how to code?</b></p>
                        <p><b>Shoaib:</b> My initial failure inspired me to code. In short, back in 2014, I had a side
                            business making websites for local small businesses. Since I wasn't a developer (yet), I
                            shipped the development work overseas. On one project, the developer started BSing me
                            &mdash;saying 'Oh this part of the site takes 3 months to make...' I was not a
                            programmer, therefore, could not verify whether the job really took as long as he was
                            claiming. Ultimately, the project failed and I had to return the client's money. The fact
                            that I didn't know enough to manage a technical person angered me, and I decided to start
                            learning how to code myself, so that I could have more control over the development process
                            next time. </p>
                        <p><b>Richard: </b>I actually learned to code when I was around ten years old. I taught myself
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>, and then
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>. I don't
                            remember exactly what drew me into it except that we had a computer (this was 1980
                            &mdash;we had one of the first Apples) that my dad used for telecommuting, and I liked video
                            games and wanted to learn how to create them. Also I liked solving puzzles. Then I got
                            really into theater in high school, and stopped programming around the age of fifteen.
                            Twenty-five years later, I was doing theater and working in New York as a production
                            graphic designer at a newspaper (I did print layout &mdash;we used computers, but not the
                            internet), and I slowly began to gravitate back to my early love of programming because a)
                            it provided a way to solve problems, both at work (through using JavaScript to script the
                            layout program Adobe InDesign) and outside work, where I created an attendance app for my
                            recreational soccer team, and b) because I began to crave having a day job that would
                            stretch my brain more than the one I was in. I still liked solving puzzles! As for whether
                            the knowledge I had from when I was a kid helped me get back into it so many years later,
                            the answer is, I have no idea. The programming languages and the ecosystems around them are
                            very different today, but I imagine that some of the basic concepts I learned in the 80s
                            remained helpful.

                        <p><b>Shoaib:</b> I started learning online, first from
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, then from
                            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a>. Eventually, I also took part-time evening classes
                            at <a href="https://nycda.com/">New York Code & Design Academy</a>, a comparatively new
                            coding bootcamp.</p>
                        <p><b>Richard: </b>In round one, starting when I was 10, I was almost entirely self-taught,
                            from manuals. There were a few other inputs to my early programming education, but I only
                            barely remember them. I took a few lessons with a game programmer who gave instruction to
                            young programmers (but whose name I forget). I also visited computer centers, where I
                            imagine they had people I could ask questions of, if not classes of some kind. In round
                            two, when I was 40, I learned by reading books and things on the internet, doing a couple
                            of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> courses, doing small code projects at
                            work (and on the Abobe forums from the ten people in the world who know what they're doing
                            in terms of scripting InDesign), going to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetups</a>
                            that I barely understood, and creating side projects and putting them up on
                            <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. In addition, I also took three short classes at
                            <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">NYU</a> continuing education (two on JavaScript and one on
                            CSS and designing for mobile). The mobile course was pretty good. The first JavaScript
                            course was very bad, but the second one was really good and instilled in me the belief that
                            I could actually do this for a living. But again, almost all of my learning was done
                            outside of those classes. The main thing I got out of them was inspiration and affirmation,
                            from the second JavaScript class. After I had been a professional software developer for a y
                            ear, I did a three month programmer's retreat called Hacker School (now called the
                            <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>), which was really fun and which I
                            think helped me to jump to another level when I was looking for my next job.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: When did you start learning how to code?</b></p>
                        <p><b>Shoaib:</b> I think I started the coding bootcamp in May 2015</p>
                        <p><b>Richard: </b>Round one: Around 1980. Round two: It was a really slow process with a lot
                            of stops and starts. I began around 2007, doing hobby projects and small scripting tasks at
                            work. Some time after that, I remember a two-year period there where I gave up on the idea
                            of actually doing it for a living, because I didn't want it to colonize my mind. Then I
                            changed my mind and started thinking seriously about doing it professionally. At the
                            beginning of 2012, I committed myself to that path by going down to half-time at my job,
                            in an irreversible way (I got a friend of mine the gig of doing half my job, and told her
                            &mdash;and only her &mdash;what my ultimate plan was, and that she could have my whole job
                            eventually, if she could stick with the part-time gig for a while). I felt I needed the
                            extra time every week to ramp up my skills, but once I took that step, I was on track to
                            either run out of savings or land a software development gig.</p>

                        <p><b>Q: How long did it take you to secure your first coding job, from the time you started
                            looking, to the time that you received an offer that you accepted?</b></p>
                        <p><b>Shoaib: </b>So I came from a very non technical background. After I completed the
                            bootcamp in the summer of 2015, getting a coding job was not even my priority. I was not
                            confident enough to apply for a technical job. I was happy enough being able to make static
                            websites and understand code a little better. However, right after completing the coding
                            bootcamp, I started teaching others how to code in a small paid setting. That gave me the
                            experience needed to get hired by <a href="http://www2.cuny.edu/">CUNY</a> in 2016, teaching
                            <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-rules.page">TLC laws</a>. Meanwhile, I
                            started my Master's in Computer Science in 2016, and graduated in May 2018. After I
                            graduated, I started actively looking for a development job in September 2018, then
                            finally accepted an offer in December 2018.

                            was ready, I got more systematic about the job search, and it took me another three months

                            example, it's better to select a stack such as javascript, then become an expert on it,
                            before moving onto a different stack.</p>

                            Git isn't as scary as it seems at first. Whenever you find yourself frustrated trying to
                            figure out what it's doing, go to
                            <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">this</a> site. It won't help you
                            with your immediate issue, but it will make you feel better.

                            It is very common for people to be unable to imagine themselves as "real programmers". The
                            lack of ability to make that cognitive leap definitely affected me, for years, before I got
                            the confidence to get serious. And I am literally a while male who started coding in the
                            80s, so you know if someone with all my pre-existing privileges and advantages had a
                            problem with that, it must be a common issue. Now that I have been getting paid to program
                            for the past five years, I cannot stress highly enough that there is NO SUCH THING as a
                            "real programmer". There are only gradations on a continuum of experience levels. Also,
                            read <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2014/01/programmer-privilege-as-an-asian-male-computer-science-major-everyone-gave-me-the-benefit-of-the-doubt.html">
                            this</a>. It's a great article about what "real programmers" look like, with a plot twist
                            in the middle.

                            Don't be intimidated by the jerks that you meet in this business (and there will be a few).
                            You can safely ignore them and their advice. The very best programmers are often nice,
                            humble people. If they didn't know how to listen, they would never have gotten to where
                            they are.
