                            I am what many would call a 'self taught' software engineer. I'm full-time, back end
                            software engineer at <a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a>, and yet I don't possess any
                            formal education in computer science (or anything even close to it). As a self-taught
                            engineer, I frequently get asked how I successfully transitioned into development without
                            any formal training. I get this question so frequently that I decided to pose it to five
                            other self-taught engineers. I found their stories informative, inspiring, and at times
                            downright hilarious. Read on to learn how these five individuals transformed themselves
                            from novice newcomers that they once were, to the professional programmers that they are
                            today.

                        <h2>Q: What inspired you to learn how to code?</h2>

                        <p><b>Dave: </b> I visited a start-up incubator in New York and watched people design web and
                            mobile apps. It was exciting. I wanted in.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p><b>Krystal: </b>Honestly, it was my husband. We had just started dating. As a software
                            engineer himself, he told me he thought I could program and program well. I never liked
                            math in school and somehow thought math would be connected to basic programming, so I
                            laughed at his suggestions. For a year, he repeated, “Hey, I think you can do it.” Finally,
                            he found something that piqued my interest. I’m a huge art fan, so he bought a Typography
                            of the Web course. I ate it up. I wanted to create something with code. He told me about
                            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy.com</a>. I finished their HTML & CSS
                            course and felt inspired. From there, I begin to seek out other resources to continue
                            coding. It was fun!
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p><b>Shoaib: </b>In short, back in 2014, I had a side business making websites for small
                            businesses. Since I was not a developer (yet), I shipped the development work overseas.
                            On one project, the developer started BSing me &mdash;saying 'Oh this part of the site
                            takes 3 months to make...' I was not a programmer, therefore, I could not verify whether the
                            job really took as long as he was claiming. Ultimately, the project failed and I had to
                            return the client's money. The fact that I didn't know enough to manage a technical person
                            angered me, and I decided to start learning how to code myself, so that I could have more
                            control over the development process next time.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p><b>Richard: </b>I actually learned to code when I was around ten years old. I taught myself
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>, and then
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a>. I don't
                            remember exactly what drew me into it except that we had a computer (this was 1980
                            &mdash;we had one of the first Apples) that my dad used for telecommuting, and I liked video
                            games and wanted to learn how to create them. Then I got really into theater in high
                            school, and stopped programming around the age of fifteen. Twenty-five years later, I was
                            doing theater and working in New York as a production graphic designer at a newspaper
                            (I did print layout &mdash;we used computers, but not the internet), and I slowly began
                            to gravitate back to my early love of programming because:
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>It provided a way to solve problems, both at work through using JavaScript to
                                    script the layout program Adobe InDesign, and outside work where I created an
                                    attendance app for my recreational soccer team</li>
                                <li>Because I began to crave having a day job that would stretch my brain more than the
                                    one I was in.</li>
                            </ol>
                            As for whether
                            the knowledge I had from when I was a kid helped me get back into it so many years later,
                            the answer is, I have no idea. The programming languages and the ecosystems then are
                            very different today, but I imagine that some of the basic concepts I learned in the 80s
                            remained helpful.

                        <p><b>Abby: </b>My senior year in college I took at Web Design course that introduced me to
                            programming. It was an enlightening experience, but it was way too late to change my major
                            to computer science. After college, I saw friends, previous classmates, and co-workers who
                            had already stepped into the software engineering world. I saw what they were creating and
                            contributing to and I wanted to join in the fun too!

                        <p><b>Dave: </b> I had taken courses in C++ and Java while in high school. Didn't code for the
                            next 10 years. Then I enrolled in a 3-month web development immersion course at

                        <p><b>Shoaib:</b> I started learning online, first from
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, then from
                            <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. Eventually, I also took part-time
                            evening classes at <a href="https://nycda.com/">New York Code & Design Academy</a>, a
                            comparatively new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_bootcamp">coding bootcamp</a>
                            at the time, back in 2015. This bootcamp was a door opener for me. It gave me the
                            opportunity to meet meet other coders for the first time, and it gave me a community of
                            people who I could ask questions of when I was stuck.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Richard: </b>In round one, starting when I was 10, I was almost entirely self-taught,
                            from manuals. In round two, when I was 40, I learned by reading books and things on the
                            internet, doing a couple of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> courses,
                            doing small code projects at work (and on the Abobe forums from the ten people in the world
                            who know what they're doing in terms of scripting InDesign), going to Meetups that I barely
                            understood, and creating side projects and putting them up on
                            <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. In addition, I also took three short continuing
                            education classes at
                            <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">NYU</a> (two on JavaScript and one on CSS and designing for
                            mobile). The mobile course was pretty good. The first JavaScript course was very bad, but
                            the second one was really good and instilled in me the belief that I could actually do this
                            for a living. But again, almost all of my learning was done outside of those classes.
                            The main thing I got out of them was inspiration and affirmation. After I had been a
                            professional software developer for a year, I did a three month programmer's retreat called
                            Hacker School (now called the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>), which
                            was really fun and which I think helped me to jump to another level when I was looking for
                            my next job.

                            2014. I didn’t seriously start learning to code until mid 2015. Yeah, it took a while for
                            me to realize I wanted to do it. (That’s OK!)

                            of stops and starts. I began around 2007, doing hobby projects and small scripting tasks at
                            work. Some time after that, I remember a two-year period there where I gave up on the idea
                            of actually doing it for a living, because I didn't want it to colonize my mind. Then I
                            changed my mind and started thinking seriously about doing it professionally. At the
                            beginning of 2012, I committed myself to that path by going down to half-time at my job,
                            in an irreversible way. I got a friend of mine the gig of doing half my job, and told her
                            &mdash;and only her &mdash;what my ultimate plan was, and that she could have my whole job eventually,
                            if she could stick with the part-time gig for a while. I felt I needed the extra time every
                            week to ramp up my skills, but once I took that step, I was on track to either run out of
                            savings or land a software development gig.</p>

                            bootcamp in the summer of 2015, getting a coding job was not even my priority. I was not
                            confident enough to apply for a technical job. I was happy enough being able to make static
                            websites and understand code a little better. However, right after completing the coding
                            bootcamp, I started teaching how to code in a small paid setting. That gave me the
                            experience needed to get hired by <a href="http://www2.cuny.edu/">CUNY</a> in 2016, teaching
                            <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-rules.page">TLC laws</a>. Meanwhile, I
                            started my Master's in Computer Science in 2016, and graduated in May 2018. After I
                            graduated, I started actively looking for a development job in September 2018, and then
                            finally accepted an offer in December 2018.

                            was ready, I got more systematic about the job search, and it took me another three months

                                <li>Give yourself a solid foundation in computer science and programming basics. Take
                                    classes like
                                    <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">this one</a>,
                                    and when you get some programming under your belt, take classes like
                                    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages">this</a>.
                                </li>
                                <li>Don't worry too much about the framework of the moment, or even the programming
                                    language of the moment (although you do have to learn at least one programming
                                    language well to get started!). You will have to constantly learn so many details
                                    about frameworks and systems every day on this job, that the permanent things you
                                    want to store in your brain are the fundamental concepts &mdash;all the other stuff
                                    will end up being crowded out and replaced by similar but different arcane minutiae
                                    on your next project anyway.
                                </li>
                                <li>Create projects that solve actual problems in your life, which gives you a feeling
                                    for what programming can do. For instance, I created an attendance website for my
                                    soccer team, because all of the existing solutions at the time either didn't do
                                    what we needed, or came with too many annoying bells and whistles.</li>

                        <p><b>Abby: </b>It’s not just about coding, but also learning the fundamentals of it all. It's
                            easy to get carried away with shortcuts like ES6,  jQuery or frameworks. You'll take things
                            for granted and never really understand how or why they work under the hood. Take the time
                            to learn the fundamentals so then you'll have the solid foundation to move around from
                            language to language. Dabble in some C++ and you'll see what I mean :).

                        <p><b>Dave: </b>I would not have learned as much as I did in a 3-month period had I not joined
                            an in-person bootcamp. And five years later, I'm still in contact with classmates.

                        <p><b>Kavan: </b>It will be hard. Figure out what calms you and helps you get your head back in
                            the game. There will be frustrating times. You will have anxiety and impostor syndrome.
                            Know that. Own it and prepare for it. Exercise works for some people (ex. taking walking
                            breaks). I found out meditation works best for me and it’s one of the reasons I chose to
                            work at my current company. I recommend
                            <a href="https://www.simplehabit.com/kindness-to-self">this</a> meditation for frustrating
                            times.

                        <p><b>Shoaib: </b> You can get there by envisioning yourself as already being there.
                            Our brain can barely distinguish what's really happening and what's just happening in our
                            head. That's why we get scared when we watch a horror movie, even though we know we just
                            paid to see what we know is fake. See yourself hired and successful, and you will be.

                            yourself. Everything takes time. Self doubt is real. Power through those moments and don't
                            give up! You can do it and remember to study study study and practice practice practice!
