                            One might call me a 'self taught' software engineer. By that, I mean I don't have a degree
                            in computer science or anything close to it, and I learned how to code without any 'formal'
                            education (although I have completed a few coding courses and have received lots of amazing
                            support from my community as I learned how to code, hence the quotes when I say that I'm
                            'self taught'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a 'self-taught' engineer who now works for a rather prominent, NYC-based tech company
                            &mdash;<a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a> &mdash;I frequently get asked:
                            'How did you do it? How did you transition from a completely non-technical role, into a
                            full-time software engineering role?'
                        </p>
                            Whenever I get asked this question, I suspect that the real question that people have isn't
                            necessarily how I personally made this transition, but more generally, how does the
                            average, non-technical person make such a drastic career transition into development? So,
                            in an attempt to answer that deeper question, I posed it to five of my self-taught
                            colleagues, so that we can all gain a bit more insight into how some have successfully made
                            the leap.

                                    the developers I knew. One of my projects <br>

                                    takes 3 months to make...". I was not a <br>
