                            <b>Virtual Environment:</b>Have you ever tried to make the exact same dish in two different
                            ovens, and found that the dish tasted slightly different between the two? Have you ever
                            washed the same clothes in two different washing machines, only to discovered that your
                            clothes felt slightly different after they came out of one washing machine vs. the other? A
                            similar phenomenon can happen when you're building Python applications. It's possible for
                            the exact same app to behave differently from computer to computer, due to differences
                            between the two computers. In fact, the same Python program might even behave differently
                            if you run it on the <i>same</i>computer several weeks apart, depending on what you've been
                            doing on that computer in the meantime. Virtual environments solve this problem. A virtual
                            environment a place on your computer where, if you run a program in that environment, it
                            will always produce the same results. It's kind of like a special canister in a larger
                            washing machine that makes sure that your clothes turn out perfectly every time. I strongly
                            recommend doing all Python development in a virtual environment. To learn more about
