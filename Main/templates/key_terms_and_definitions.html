                            <b><a href="#immutable">Immutable: </a></b>An object is immutable if its value cannot be
                            changed after that object is created. In every programming language that I've worked in to
                            date, strings are immutable objects: You can change the reference to a string, but you
                            cannot change the string itself after you create it. The opposite of an immutable object is a

                            of 'mutable' is "prone to change". In context of programming, mutability is a term used to
                            refer to an object whose state can be changed after it is created. An example of
                            a mutable object is a list (or 'array' depending on the language that you're working in),
                            because one can modify a list after creation, e.g. by adding items to/from it. The
                            opposite of a mutable object is an

                            same dish from two different
                            serving containers, and noticed that it tasted just a <i>little</i> but different when
                            eaten from one container (e.g. a plastic one) vs. another (e.g. a cardboard one)? Ok,
                            maybe you're not a picky eater like I am and you've never noticed, but I swear it happens,
                            and just like the same food tastes different from container to container, the same code can
                            perform differently from laptop to laptop. That's where virtual environments come in. A
                            virtual environment is a place in memory on your computer that you create and run your code
                            in in order to ensure that the code
                            where you can run a program and have confidence that the program
                            will always behave the same way. It's kind of like a special canister in a larger washing
                            machine that makes sure that your clothes turn out perfectly every time. I strongly
                            recommend doing all Python development in a virtual environment. To learn more about
